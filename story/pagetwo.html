                With that, Luna slipped outside, her nimble paws silent on the soft grass. She crept toward the butterfly, which fluttered about, almost as if it was playing a game. Max, oblivious to Luna's careful approach, bounded after the butterfly with his usual enthusiasm. He was about to chase it right into the bush when Luna called out, "Wait! Let me show you."

Max stopped, panting, and watched as Luna padded slowly towards the butterfly. With one swift leap, she arched through the air and landed softly, using her paw to gently coax the butterfly into a nearby flower. She didn't chase it, but rather waited for it to rest, allowing her the perfect moment to observe.

Max was in awe. "Wow! You're so graceful! I never would have thought to do it like that."
